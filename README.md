- 👋 Hi, I’m @doughogan
- I work for Confluent as a technical trainer, teaching Apache(R) Kafka classes. 
- 👀 I’m currently most interested in and learning more about asciidoc and reveal.js for course materials. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reveal.js and generating awesome slide decks and handbooks for students and instructors from asciidoc.
